# Anonymous Chatbot Telegram Bot

Welcome to **Anonymous Chatbot**, a Telegram bot that allows users to chat anonymously with a random stranger. This project is written in **C#** and uses the Telegram Bot API to facilitate anonymous conversations in a simple and efficient way.

## Features

- **Anonymous Matching**: Users can connect to a random stranger anonymously and start chatting.
- **Easy Commands**: The bot offers intuitive commands like `/start` and `/connect` for a seamless user experience.
- **Queue System**: Users are added to a waiting queue and paired automatically when a partner becomes available.
- **Message Forwarding**: Messages are relayed between paired users without revealing their identities.

---

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The bot starts and listens for incoming messages using the Telegram Bot API.
2. **User Commands**:
   - `/start`: Welcomes the user and provides instructions.
   - `/connect`: Adds the user to the waiting queue and pairs them with a random stranger.
3. **Pairing Users**: When two users are in the queue, they are paired, and their messages are forwarded to each other anonymously.
4. **Messaging**: Users can chat until they decide to disconnect or close the conversation.

## Example Usage

1. User starts the bot by typing `/start`.
   - Bot responds: "Welcome! Type /connect to chat anonymously with someone."

2. User types `/connect`.
   - Bot adds the user to the queue and matches them with a partner when available.

3. Users exchange messages through the bot anonymously.

## Future Improvements
